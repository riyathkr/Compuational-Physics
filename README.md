In this repository, you can find various numerical algorithms and their application in solving Physics related equations

## Root finding Algorithms: 
1. I discuss few root finding algorithms - **Newton Raphson, Bisection Program and Secant.**
2. Solved the **Schrodinger Equation for a finite well problem** using a hybrid root finding algorithm - obtained odd parity and even parity solutions. Theory for the same is available in Griffith's.

## Differential Equations (ODE's):
1. Analysed **Euler's method and Runge Kutta methods** for solving an ordinary differential Equation - effect of varying the step size and differential functions on the error.
2. Applied the above methods to numerically solve for the **Simple Harmonic Oscillations.**

## Partial Differential Equations:
Solved the **heat/diffusion PDE** using analytical methods:-
1. **Explicit Forward Euler method**
2. **Implicit Backward Euler method and
3. **Crank Nicolson method.

Although I have solved for dirichlet boundary conditions, the code can be easily tweaked for neumann boundary conditions.
