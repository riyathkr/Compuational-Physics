Numerical algorithms applied to problems of Physics
In this repository, I have uploaded my solutions of numerical methods applied to various questions and equations of Physics:

1. Solved the Schrodinger Equation for a finite well problem using root finding algorithms - obtained odd parity and even parity solutions. Theory for the same is available in Griffith's.
2. Analysed Euler's method and Runge Kutta methods for solving a differential Equation - effect of varying the step size and differential functions on the error.\
3. Applied the above methods to numerically solve for the Simple Harmonic Oscillations.
