Numerical algorithms applied to problems of Physics
In this repository, I have uploaded my solutions of numerical methods applied to various questions and equations of Physics:

## Root finding Algorithms: 
1. I discuss few root finding algorithms - Newton Raphson, Bisection Program and Secant.
2. Solved the Schrodinger Equation for a finite well problem using a hybrid root finding algorithm - obtained odd parity and even parity solutions. Theory for the same is available in Griffith's.

## Differential Equations:
1. Analysed Euler's method and Runge Kutta methods for solving a differential Equation - effect of varying the step size and differential functions on the error.
2. Applied the above methods to numerically solve for the Simple Harmonic Oscillations.
