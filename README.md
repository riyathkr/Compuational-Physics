Numerical algorithms applied to problems of Physics
In this repository, I have uploaded my solutions of numerical methods applied to various questions and equations of Physics:

## Root finding Algorithms: 
1. I discuss few root finding algorithms - Newton Raphson, Bisection Program and Secant.
2. Solved the Schrodinger Equation for a finite well problem using a hybrid root finding algorithm - obtained odd parity and even parity solutions. Theory for the same is available in Griffith's.

## Differential Equations (ODE's):
1. Analysed Euler's method and Runge Kutta methods for solving an ordinary differential Equation - effect of varying the step size and differential functions on the error.
2. Applied the above methods to numerically solve for the Simple Harmonic Oscillations. 

## Partial Differential Equations:
Solved the heat/diffusion PDE using analytical methods:-
1. Explicit Forward Euler method
2. Implicit Backward Euler method and
3. Crank Nicolson method.

Although I have solved for dirichlet boundary conditions, the code can be easily tweaked for neumann boundary conditions.
